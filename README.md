# [Get Started With Core Data][published url]
## Instructor: [Markus Mühlberger][instructor url]


Core Data is a very powerful framework for managing data, though it can be daunting to learn at first. It is hugely popular and well documented and has been around for years: both on iOS and OS X. Core Data is maintained by Apple and is very well documented. The result is an easy to use framework for managing an object graph that is elegant to use and incredibly efficient in terms of memory usage.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Markus Mühlberger will show you how to use Core Data on iOS. You'll learn about the components of a Core Data stack, creating and manipulating, relationships, filtering, and data migration. Along the way, you'll get to follow along as Markus builds a full-featured app for quiz masters, to create and edit quizes.
